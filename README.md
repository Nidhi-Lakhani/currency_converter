# currency_converter

This is a realtime currency converter in Python using its tkinter and requests module for UI and making URL requests. There are five steps into building this project - Real-time Exchange rates, Import required Libraries, CurrencyConverter Class, UI for CurrencyConverter and the Main Function. The requests library is used to get realtime currency exchange rates using its API and the tkinter module is used to make a UI application for our project.
